1. **Demo-First**: Prove core value proposition without authentication complexity
2. **End-to-End Value**: Complete user journey demonstrated in Sprint 1
3. **Foundation-After-Proof**: Build authentication after proving concept works
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Complex integrations tackled after value is proven

**Total Scope**: 89 stories, 542 story points (*see @gen_backlogfull.md for complete breakdown*)  
**Demo MVP**: 15 stories, 76 points (split across 2 sprints)
