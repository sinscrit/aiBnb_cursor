    - Routes configured

16-24. ✅ Frontend Implementation Tasks
    - Status: Complete
    - Evidence: Pages loading with data
    - Required: Testing remaining features

25. ✅ API Client and Utilities
    - Status: Complete
    - Evidence: Frontend-backend connectivity working
    - Required: Additional error handling improvements

## Critical Issues

✅ Frontend-Backend Connectivity - RESOLVED
   - Fixed: Next.js proxy configuration updated
   - Fixed: API endpoints now accessible through proxy
   - Fixed: Dashboard data loading working

✅ API Client Configuration - RESOLVED
   - Fixed: API client using correct proxy URLs
   - Fixed: CORS issues resolved through proxy
   - Fixed: TypeScript types added for API responses

⚠️ Testing Infrastructure
   - Issue: No automated tests running
   - Status: Setup required

## Next Steps

1. Complete Frontend Feature Testing
   - Test edit/delete operations
   - Test QR code generation
   - Test content display system

2. Setup Testing Infrastructure
