## REQ-001: Implement Sprint MVP1 - Content Creation & QR Generation

**Date**: June 30, 2025  
**Type**: Implementation Request  
**Status**: Pending  
**Story Points**: 42 points (8 stories)

### Request Description
Implement Sprint MVP1 as described in the development plan, which includes foundational content creation and QR code generation functionality using a hardcoded "Demo User" approach.

### Scope
Implementation of 8 user stories from Sprint MVP1:

**Content Creation & Management (23 points):**
- Story 2.1.1: Property Registration (5 points)
- Story 2.2.1: Property Listing (3 points)
- Story 3.1.1: Item Registration (5 points)
- Story 3.1.3: Item Location Tracking (3 points)
- Story 3.2.3: Item Deletion (5 points)

**QR Code Generation (13 points):**
- Story 4.1.1: Individual QR Code Generation (8 points)
- Story 4.2.1: QR Code to Item Mapping (5 points)

**Basic Content Display (8 points):**
- Story 6.1.1: Dynamic Content Page Generation (8 points)

### Expected Value Flow
Create property → Add locations → Add items → Generate QR codes → View content page (via direct URL)

### Reference Documents
- **[@docs/gen_devplan.md](./gen_devplan.md)**: Source document containing Sprint MVP1 specification (lines 44-66)
- **[@docs/gen_backlogfull.md](./gen_backlogfull.md)**: Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria and prioritization
- **[@docs/gen_architecture.md](./gen_architecture.md)**: Technical architecture for hybrid Supabase + Node.js/Express implementation
- **[@docs/user_productbrief.md](./user_productbrief.md)**: Project requirements and stakeholder objectives

### Complexity Analysis

**Complexity Level**: Medium-High

**Technical Components Required:**
1. **Project Setup & Architecture**
   - Initialize hybrid Supabase + Node.js/Express stack
   - Configure development environment and dependencies
   - Set up database schema and connections

2. **Backend Development**
   - Database models and schema for properties, items, and QR codes
   - API endpoints for CRUD operations
   - QR code generation logic and mapping system
   - Hardcoded "Demo User" implementation

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Web application interface for content creation
   - Property and item management forms
   - QR code display and generation interface
   - Dynamic content page rendering

4. **Integration & Testing**
   - End-to-end workflow validation
   - QR code generation and mapping verification
   - Content page dynamic generation testing

**Risk Factors:**
- Medium: First-time setup of hybrid Supabase + Node.js architecture
- Low: Well-defined scope with no authentication complexity
- Low: Clear acceptance criteria from backlog documentation

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days for complete implementation

**Dependencies:**
- Access to Supabase project configuration
- Node.js development environment setup
- QR code generation library selection and integration

### Implementation Notes
- Uses hardcoded "Demo User" to avoid authentication complexity
- Focus on proving core value proposition before adding user management
- Foundation for subsequent MVP2 sprint (QR scanning and mobile experience)
